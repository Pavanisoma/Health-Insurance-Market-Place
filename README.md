# Health-Insurance-Market-Place
Conducted statistical analysis on insurance data (2014-2016) and provided resourceful solutions to problems often faced by insureds by cleaning data and designing neural network models. Performed end to end analysis to identify gaps using SQLite and R.

SCOPE:
Citizens/Employees who take health insurance.

STEPS TO FOLLOW:

Step 1: Define the question 

The main aim of our project is to answer insurance related questions.

Step 2: Decide what to measure and how to measure 

Even though we have many tables our main focus will be on below tables

1.	Rates
2.	PlanAttributes
3.	ServiceArea 
4.	BenefitsCostSharing 

Step 3: Collect data

The data set can be obtained from below site

Step 4: Analyze the data

We will manipulate the data by plotting or by correlating data between columns. 
Our current approach to modeling data is a linear regression model. Based on the complexity the model can be changed to Decision Trees.

Step 5: Interpret results

●	After analyzing the data we will interpret the results. We will see if the data present is able to answer the question.

RESOURCES:
●	This data was originally prepared and released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Found the data from below resource
